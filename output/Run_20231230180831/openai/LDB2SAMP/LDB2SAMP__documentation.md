This COBOL program is used to interact with a database, specifically to count the number of employees in the database, add a new employee, and then retrieve and display the details of the newly added employee.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the code:

1. `IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.` and `PROGRAM-ID. LDB2SAMP.`: These lines are used to identify the program. The program name is LDB2SAMP.

2. `DATA DIVISION.` and `WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.`: This is where the data items used in the program are defined.

3. `EXEC SQL INCLUDE SQLCA END-EXEC.`: This line includes the SQL Communications Area (SQLCA), which is a group of variables used to communicate between the COBOL program and the DB2 database.

4. `01 EMPLOYEE.`: This is the definition of the EMPLOYEE record layout. It contains fields like EMPNO (employee number), FIRSTNME (first name), LASTNAME (last name), WORKDEPT (work department), PHONENO (phone number), HIREDATE (hire date), JOB (job title), EDLEVEL (education level), SEX (gender), BIRTHDATE (birth date), SALARY, BONUS, and COMM (commission).

5. `01 VARIABLES.`: This is the definition of various other variables used in the program.

6. `LINKAGE SECTION.`: This section is used to describe data items that are passed from one program to another.

7. `PROCEDURE DIVISION.`: This is where the program logic is written.

8. `MOVE LOW-VALUES TO VARIABLES.`: This line initializes all the variables to their lowest possible values.

9. `EXEC SQL SELECT COUNT (*) INTO :RECORDCOUNT FROM EMPLOYEE END-EXEC.`: This SQL statement counts the number of records in the EMPLOYEE table and stores the result in the RECORDCOUNT variable.

10. The `IF SQLCODE = 0 THEN` block: This block checks the SQLCODE returned by the previous SQL statement. If it's 0 (which means the SQL statement was successful), it moves the record count to DISPLAYRC and constructs a message in OUT. If the SQLCODE is 100 (which means no rows were found), it moves a different message to OUT. If the SQLCODE is anything else (which indicates an error), it moves an error message and the SQLCODE to OUT.

11. `DISPLAY OUT.`: This line displays the message stored in OUT.

12. The `IF SQLCODE = 0 THEN` block: This block executes if the previous SQL statement was successful. It retrieves the maximum employee number, increments it, assigns it to the new employee, assigns values to the other fields of the new employee, inserts the new employee into the database, retrieves the details of the newly added employee, commits the transaction, and displays the first and last names of the new employee and a confirmation message. If there's an SQL error, it displays an error message.

13. `GOBACK.`: This line ends the program.
