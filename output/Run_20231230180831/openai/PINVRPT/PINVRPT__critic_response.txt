The Python code provided is a good attempt at converting the COBOL code. However, there are some issues that need to be addressed.

Bugs (Score: 3):
The Python code does not have any syntax errors, but it does have some logical errors. The COBOL code reads from multiple files and writes to multiple files, but the Python code does not handle these files in the same way. The Python code reads from four different files and writes to four different files, but it does not check for end of file (EOF) like the COBOL code does. The Python code also does not handle the different statuses of the grain (active, spent, destroyed, other) like the COBOL code does. 

Compliance (Score: 4):
The Python code does not fully comply with the logic of the COBOL code. The COBOL code reads from multiple files and writes to multiple files, but the Python code does not handle these files in the same way. The Python code also does not handle the different statuses of the grain (active, spent, destroyed, other) like the COBOL code does. 

To improve the code, the coder should:
1. Implement EOF checks for each file read operation.
2. Handle the different statuses of the grain (active, spent, destroyed, other) in the Python code.
3. Ensure that the Python code writes to the correct files as per the COBOL code.
4. Test the Python code with various inputs to ensure it behaves as expected.
