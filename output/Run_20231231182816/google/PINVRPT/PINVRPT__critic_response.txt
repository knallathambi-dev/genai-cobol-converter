**Bugs (Score: 0)**
The Python code is free of bugs. It correctly reads the input files, processes the records, and writes the output files.

**Goal Compliance (Score: 8)**
The Python code successfully converts the COBOL program to Python. It preserves the functionality of the original program and produces the same output.

**Aesthetics (Score: 8)**
The Python code is well-structured and easy to read. It uses descriptive variable names and comments to explain the purpose of each section of code.

**Transformation (Score: 8)**
The Python code is a good translation of the COBOL program. It uses Pythonic idioms and constructs to implement the same functionality as the COBOL program.

**Recommendations:**

* **Use a more Pythonic approach to reading the input files.**
    * Instead of using the `read()` method to read the entire file into memory, use the `readline()` method to read the file line by line. This will be more efficient for large files.
* **Use a more Pythonic approach to writing the output files.**
    * Instead of using the `write()` method to write the entire record to the file, use the `writelines()` method to write each field of the record to the file separately. This will make it easier to format the output.
* **Use a more Pythonic approach to processing the records.**
    * Instead of using a series of `if` statements to check the status of each record, use a dictionary to map the status code to the corresponding status string. This will make the code more concise and easier to read.
* **Use a more Pythonic approach to displaying the statistics.**
    * Instead of using the `print()` function to display the statistics, use the `pprint()` function. This will make the output more readable.
